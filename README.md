# Prediction-of-Breast-Cancer-wisconsin-data
# Introduction
The dataset was gotten forom Kaggle for a project to sharpen our Python, Machine learning skills using googlecolab. The datasets gives a breakdown of breast cancer reports and categories 'B' Benign cancer, 'M' Malignant cancer with a 569 rows and 33 columns, the datasets consist of both numerical and categorical data.

# Data Analysis
we imported our libraries and models for analysis, we romoved null values and fixed missing values and errors then we performed 
*label encoding and one hot encoding to transform categorical variables to numerical variables (dummy_variables) for us to do further analysis like training and testing our datasets for predictions.
